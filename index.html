        <h3>Hey there! This page marks the beginning of my 15 week journey into a promising career as a software engineer!</h3>

          <p>  I was a gardener and arborist by trade until both a previous disability and a back injury prevented me from the work I really dug (no pun intended).</p>
          <p>  I moved into my car and tried a previous side hustle as an event photographer and cinematographer, but gigs were seldom and pay wasn't great, then the pandemic hit.</p>
          <p>  However, I had a <b>ton</b> going for me as well. I had a <em>wealth of time</em> and the isolation made me focus my mind on other career paths.</p> 
          <p>  I picked up a cheap Raspberry Pi and a knock-off Arduino kit (Elegoo) and taught myself a little bit about microelectronics, embedded coding and the Command Line.</p> 
          <p>  With every successful program written I got some confidence back and eventually applied to this program.</p>
